## 💡 Expert Tips from IAS Toppers

### From Dr. Rajesh Kumar (IAS 2015, AIR 3)

> "I scored 186/200 in Prelims by following three principles: **Quality over Quantity** (5 good sources beat 20 average ones), **Revision over Coverage** (3 revisions of 80% syllabus beats 1 revision of 100%), and **Practice over Theory** (500 quality MCQs teach more than 1000 pages of reading)."

### From Priya Sharma (IAS 2023, AIR 12)

> "As a working professional, I had limited time. My strategy: **Early morning 5-7 AM** for new topics (fresh mind), **Lunch break** for current affairs, **Evening 8-10 PM** for practice tests. Consistency beats intensity—2 hours daily for 12 months beats 8 hours daily for 3 months."
