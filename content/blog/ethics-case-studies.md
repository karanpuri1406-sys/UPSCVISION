# Ethics Case Studies: Mastering GS4

General Studies Paper IV (Ethics, Integrity, and Aptitude) can be a scoring subject if approached correctly. Case studies form a crucial component requiring analytical thinking and ethical reasoning.

## Understanding the Paper Structure

- **Section A (Theory)**: 50-60 marks
  - Definitions, concepts, thinkers
  
- **Section B (Case Studies)**: 120-130 marks
  - Real-life ethical dilemmas
  - Multiple stakeholders
  - No single right answer

## Framework for Case Study Analysis

### Step 1: Identify the Problem
- What is the core ethical dilemma?
- Who are the stakeholders?
- What are the competing interests?

### Step 2: Analyze Options
- List all possible courses of action
- Evaluate each option's merits and demerits
- Consider short-term and long-term consequences

### Step 3: Apply Ethical Principles
- Consequentialism: What outcome maximizes overall good?
- Deontology: What is the right thing to do regardless of consequences?
- Virtue Ethics: What would a person of good character do?

### Step 4: Make a Decision
- Choose the most ethical course of action
- Justify your decision
- Address counterarguments

## Sample Case Study with Answer

### Question
*You are a District Magistrate. During a pandemic, your district is facing a severe shortage of hospital beds. A wealthy businessman offers to donate 50 beds if his family member, who is not critically ill, gets priority treatment. Critically ill poor patients are dying due to lack of beds. What will you do?*

### Answer Structure

**Stakeholders Identified:**
- Critically ill poor patients
- Businessman's family member
- Healthcare system
- Society at large
- Public trust in administration

**Ethical Issues:**
- Justice vs. Pragmatism
- Equality in healthcare access
- Corruption vs. urgent need
- Short-term gains vs. long-term implications

**Options Available:**

1. **Accept the offer**
   - Pros: 50 more beds, save many lives
   - Cons: Injustice, sets bad precedent, erosion of public trust

2. **Reject the offer**
   - Pros: Maintains integrity, ensures justice
   - Cons: Miss opportunity to save lives

3. **Negotiate a middle path**
   - Accept donation unconditionally
   - Ensure all patients treated based on medical priority
   - Public transparency about the donation

**My Decision:**

I would choose Option 3 with following justification:

1. **Accept the donation** but make it clear that:
   - All patients will be treated based on medical severity
   - No special privileges for any individual
   - Donation is unconditional and transparent

2. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Public announcement thanking the businessman
   - Clear communication about treatment protocols
   - Ensure transparency in bed allocation

3. **Ethical Justification:**
   - Saves more lives (utilitarian principle)
   - Maintains justice and equality
   - Preserves public trust
   - Can encourage others to donate

4. **Long-term Measures:**
   - Develop clear guidelines for donations during emergencies
   - Create transparent bed allocation system
   - Public disclosure of all donations

This approach balances immediate needs with ethical principles, ensuring both lives are saved and integrity is maintained.

## Key Principles to Remember

### 1. Gandhian Ethics
- Means are as important as ends
- Truth and non-violence
- Welfare of all (Sarvodaya)

### 2. Constitutional Values
- Justice, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity
- Rule of law
- Public service ethos

### 3. Administrative Values
- Accountability
- Transparency
- Efficiency
- Responsiveness

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Being judgmental**: Don't moralize; analyze objectively
2. **Ignoring stakeholders**: Consider all affected parties
3. **One-dimensional thinking**: Consider multiple perspectives
4. **Lack of practical solutions**: Be realistic and implementable
5. **Avoiding the dilemma**: Take a clear stand

## Practice Strategy

### Daily Practice
- Read one case study

- Write a structured answer

### Weekly Practice
