## Our Journey: From Vision to Reality

In 2020, a group of serving IAS officers and UPSC toppers identified a critical gap in India's UPSC preparation landscape. While metro cities had access to top coaching institutes, millions of aspirants in Tier 2, Tier 3 cities, and rural areas struggled with outdated materials, limited guidance, and prohibitive costs.

**UPSC Vision Prep was born from this realization** – to build a platform that combines:
- ✅ **Elite coaching quality** of top Delhi institutes
- ✅ **Affordability** accessible to every student
- ✅ **Technology-driven personalization** through AI
- ✅ **Comprehensive coverage** from Prelims to Interview

Today, we're proud to be the **#1 rated UPSC platform** with students from **650+ districts** across India.
